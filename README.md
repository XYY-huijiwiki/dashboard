## ✨ Features

- **Advanced File Management** 📂  
  Many valuable files cannot be uploaded to XYY Huijiwiki due to size restrictions or other limitations. Now, they are stored in GitHub! This dashboard acts as a bridge between Huijiwiki and GitHub, allowing you to upload, download, rename, and manage those files seamlessly.

- **Cartoon Episode Data Management** 🎬  
  Easily manage cartoon episode data with a clean, intuitive interface. Export data as a Microsoft Excel file, edit efficiently, and import it back into Huijiwiki without breaking a sweat.

- **Bulk Wiki Operations** 🔧  
  Handling a large amount of wiki operations? No worries! The dashboard includes powerful tools for renaming, find-and-replace actions, deletion, undeletion, and more. Wiki management at scale, made simple.

- **More Features Coming Soon!** 🚀  
  We're continuously improving and adding new functionalities. Stay tuned!
