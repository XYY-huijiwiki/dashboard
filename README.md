## Notes üìå

### GitHub Login Required üîë

> [!Note]
> You must log in to GitHub to use this app. Also, all files will be **read-only** unless you have admin permissions in the `XYY-huijiwiki` GitHub organisation.

### Network Connection üåç

> [!Note]
> This app requires an internet connection to access GitHub and Cloudflare. If you‚Äôre in mainland China, you might have trouble connecting.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

All files are stored as assets in GitHub releases, while file metadata is kept in a Cloudflare D1 database. With the file name, XYY Wiki can display files directly. For extra details like file source and licence, the database has your back.
